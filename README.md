# DataScienceWithPython
I will post several mini projects which I have done while studying Data Science course .Please feel free to pull a request


**Data science** is all about data.There are certain steps that are needed to be followed so that we can use the data for 
predictive analysis and other useful works.The order of these steps are very important and by following this order one
can achieve what he dreamt off.

What is Data Science?

Data Science is basically the science behind the data.The data is processed through scientific methods to make some predictions by visualizing it.

**Note-We will not be dealing with Machine Learning algorithms in details now.You can refer to my github link- for Machine Learning Tutorials.**

Language suitable for Data Science are *Python,R* and other languages.But I will prefer to use *Python* as it has got extensive libraries for data science.


These steps for any data science project which you will work in future-

1. **Aquiring Data**-Collection of data is the first part of any Data Science project.You have to get your dataset in order to start working.There are many sources from which you can get data.One of the sources are-Kaggle,MNIST dataset and the IRIS dataset(preferable for the beginners).

2. **Pre processing of Data**-This is the second step after data collection where we prepare the data for analysis.The data that we collect often turns out to be inconsistent and so we have to clean the data and this process is called Data Munging.We also have to label the unlabeled data.After this you have to do visualization.

3. **Visualisation of Data**-This is the next step after pre-processing of the data.The correlation between the features will give you a nice insight of the how the features are related to each other.

4. **Analysis of Data**- This is the step where the Machine Learning algorithms come into picture.We will apply machine learning algorithms on the dataset we are having and then predict the accuracy of the model.

5. **Report**- This is the last step where we report the outcome of the model.Like we suggest the list of similar movies upon his past movie experience.

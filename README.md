# DataScienceWithPython
I will post several mini projects which I have done while studying Data Science course .Please feel free to pull a request


**Data science** is all about data.There are certain steps that are needed to be followed so that we can use the data for 
predictive analysis and other useful works.The order of these steps are very important and by following this order one
can achieve what he dreamt off.

What is Data Science?

Data Science is basically the science behind the data.The data is processed through scientific methods to make some predictions by visualizing it.

**Note-We will not be dealing with Machine Learning algorithms in details now.You can refer to my github link- for Machine Learning Tutorials.**

Language suitable for Data Science are *Python,R* and other languages.But I will prefer to use *Python* as it has got extensive libraries for data science.


These steps for any data science project which you will work in future-

1. **Aquiring Data**-Collection of data is the first part of any Data Science project.You have to get your dataset in order to start working.There are many sources from which you can get data.One of the sources are-Kaggle,MNIST dataset and the IRIS dataset(preferable for the beginners).

2. **Pre processing of Data**-This is the second step after data collection where we prepare the data for analysis.The data that we collect often turns out to be inconsistent and so we have to clean the data and this process is called Data Munging.We also have to label the unlabeled data.After this you have to do visualization.

3. **Visualisation of Data**-This is the next step after pre-processing of the data.The correlation between the features will give you a nice insight of the how the features are related to each other.

4. **Analysis of Data**- This is the step where the Machine Learning algorithms come into picture.We will apply machine learning algorithms on the dataset we are having and then predict the accuracy of the model.

5. **Report**- This is the last step where we report the outcome of the model.Like we suggest the list of similar movies upon his past movie experience.

There are two packages in Python which will be very useful in you Data Science Journey.These packages are-Pandas and Numpy.

Numerical Python, or "Numpy" for short, is a foundational package on which many of the most common data science packages are built. Numpy provides us with high performance multi-dimensional arrays which we can use as vectors or matrices.

The key features of numpy are:

    ndarrays: n-dimensional arrays of the same data type which are fast and space-efficient. There are a number of built-in methods for ndarrays which allow for rapid processing of data without using loops (e.g., compute the mean).
    Broadcasting: a useful tool which defines implicit behavior between multi-dimensional arrays of different sizes.
    Vectorization: enables numeric operations on ndarrays.
    Input/Output: simplifies reading and writing of data from/to file.

pandas is a Python library for data analysis. It offers a number of data exploration, cleaning and transformation operations that are critical in working with data in Python.

pandas build upon numpy and scipy providing easy-to-use data structures and data manipulation functions with integrated indexing.

The main data structures pandas provides are Series and DataFrames. After a brief introduction to these two data structures and data ingestion, the key features of pandas this notebook covers are:

    Generating descriptive statistics on data
    Data cleaning using built in pandas functions
    Frequent data operations for subsetting, filtering, insertion, deletion and aggregation of data
    Merging multiple datasets using dataframes
    Working with timestamps and time-series data

Now we have learnt the basics of pandas and numpy and now we will look at Matplotlib library and do some basic exercises.In this exercise we will be doing the following things-

1. Plotting the data points.
2. Use Mask to filter out some attributes and create nd arrays.
3. Finding correlation between different features.
4. Using Histograms to explore distribution of values.

Please refer to this link-https://github.com/st186/DataScienceWithPython/blob/master/Matplotlib_Intro.ipynb for the Matplotlib tutorial.Please go through it to know the basics of this useful library.
